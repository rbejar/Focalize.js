# Focalize.js

Dynamic HTML5 presentations. Now with 55% less dizziness and 30% more fun!
For documentation and more information, go to the wiki:

## Mission statement
Focalize.js allows to create presentations in HTML5 that can be shown in modern web browsers.

It is **different** from the usual suspects, and from the not-so-usual ones:
* It encourages a strong separation between content and style; stronger than the templates that common presentation applications provide. This puts less control in the hands of those **creating** presentations and more control in the hands of those **designing** their styles.
* When every HTML5 designer out there is creating a web site with vertical parallax scroll, Focalize.js first approach is horizontal parallax scroll. Way cool, isn't it? xP
* Flat design? No, please, don't do that... xD It may be possible to design a style for Focalize.js which can be labeled as flat, but it is not the best tool for that.
* Will you feel dizzy after watching a Focalize.js presentation? Most probably you won't, but I can't promise... xP

## Audience
* For now, myself (eat your own dog food...). In a short future, I expect that some brave, smart and good-looking early adopters could be interested.
* The main use case is showing a presentation hosted locally in your computer with a modern web browser. Presentations work online too, of course, but making them light, supporting old browsers (or every browser out there), etc. are not priorities right now.
* Focalize.js will not be useful for every kind of presentation: those with lots of text, with very specific layouts, with a clear poster-like metaphor behind them or that must be provided in standard or common formats should be done with different software.

## Development 
I am one person working in my free time. I suggest patience, plenty of water and lots of rest (the last two are always good advice ;-)

## License
Focalize.js is [**GPL Version 3**](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). 

If some parts could be released as plugins (e.g. jQuery plugins), libraries or components, I will probably release them with a dual MIT/GPL v3 license, but I will decide on a case-by-case basis.

## Credits
Focalize.js uses a number of free components and libraries. As the list is evolving as the development goes on, this document may be outdated, but I will try to keep it up to date.
